    "Example, if I was able to retire early the year before my daughter goes to college, would she get aid as if her parents made no money, or would the college realize I have large investments and take that into account? Do you have to report capital gains on a fafsa? Would you have to retire two years before she applied for school for this to work? I realize this is gaming the system; I might not do it even if it works; just curious since we will be projecting a retirement soon after they leave for college in any event.\n",
    "•\tWhat is the correct amount to save in a 529?\n",
    "We've been dropping $500/month into it, which is a lot. If we continue, it should come close to $250,000 by the time she is 18. My thought is that would allow her to go private school for undergrad, or go public school undergrad and graduate if desired. But, I also worry that we are putting too much in there, and if my child goes public for undergrad and doesn't need the rest, that we will pay the 10% penalty, and we would have been better off saving the money in a taxable investment account where we would have had added flexibility. I do avoid a 6.5% state income tax on anything that we put in the 529 so if she is going to need it I definitely want to put it in the 529!\n",
    "•\tWhen the second child comes along, do you start a second 529? It does not appear you can do two beneficiaries on one account. So if you start a second 529, do you fund it equally, or do you fund the younger one a little less, knowing you can change the beneficiary when the older child graduates to benefit the younger child?\n",
